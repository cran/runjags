Description: User-friendly interface utilities for MCMC models via 
	Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS), facilitating the use of parallel 
	(or distributed) processors for multiple chains, automated control
	of convergence and sample length diagnostics, and evaluation of the 
	performance of a model using drop-k validation or against simulated
	data. Template model specifications can be generated using a standard
	lme4-style formula interface to assist users less familiar with the 
	BUGS syntax.  A JAGS extension module provides additional distributions 
	including the Pareto family of distributions, the DuMouchel prior and 
	the half-Cauchy prior.
